#### How to use the search engine

The search engine is divided into three parts: To the left there is a searchfield where you can type a searchword exapmle:(title, name, IMT2293 etc.). The search engine is NOT case sensitiv, and you don't have to write the exactly correct word to get results. To the right there are a couple of checkboxes, which acts as filters for your search. You can simply choose which checkboxes you want to filer by. In the middle is where the Search-Button is.
After you have typed a searchword and choosen which filers to use you may click the search-button to get your results.
There is a small bug inside the search engine where you have to press the search-button twice to get it to desplay what you have searched for.
